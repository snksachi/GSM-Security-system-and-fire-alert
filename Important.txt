
Since SIM800L module doesnâ€™t come with onboard voltage regulator, an external power supply adjusted to voltage between 3.4V to 4.4V (Ideal 4.1V) is required. 
The power supply should also be able to source 2A of surge current, otherwise the module will keep shutting down.

Any 2A-rated DC-DC buck converter like LM2596 would work.
The LM2596S can provide a maximum 3 A to its load. 
You simply use a higher voltage in its input then adjust the on-board potentiometer to have 3.7 to 4.4 V for the SIM800L
